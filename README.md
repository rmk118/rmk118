## Hi there 👋

I'm a PhD student in the [Brady lab](https://umaine.edu/bradylab/) at the University of Maine School of Marine Sciences.

- 🦀 I’m currently working on [modeling crustacean size at maturity](https://ruby.science/thesis_proposal/)
- 🐟 I’m a quantitative marine ecologist interested in the intersection of data science and sustainable fisheries (& aquaculture)
- ⭐ I'm passionate about reproducible research, open science, and FAIR data
- 👟 Fun fact: I am an avid runner and currently compete on the UMaine track and cross-country teams! Go Black Bears! 🐻
